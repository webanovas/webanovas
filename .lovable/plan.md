# WebAnovas.com — Company Website

Recreating the WebAnovas website as a React single-page application with the same dark, minimalist, premium aesthetic and all existing content.

## Design System
- **Dark theme** with deep navy/black background and subtle blue gradient accents
- **Bold white typography** for headings, muted gray for body text
- **Blue badge/tag labels** (e.g. "PERFORMANCE", "FRONT-END") as accent elements
- **Glass-morphic dark cards** with subtle borders for content sections
- Clean, spacious layout with generous whitespace

## Navigation
- **Bottom-center floating navigation bar** (pill-shaped, dark with blur backdrop) containing: Home, Services, Work, Process, About, and a "Start Project" CTA button
- Active page highlighted with a subtle background change
- Smooth page transitions between routes
